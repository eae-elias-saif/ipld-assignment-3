Assignment for eae/ipld class - December 2025

Instructions:
Find a dataset of your interest (you can use Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other public source). The dataset should be in CSV format and contain between 500 and 2000 rows and between 5 and 10 columns. If you find one with more data, feel free to filter it down to the required size.

Using Python and SQL, perform the following tasks:



1. Share the dataset source link, a brief description of its content and your motivation for choosing it.

2. Load the dataset using Pandas.

3. Make some basic data profiling (statistics about the data, distributions, missing values, etc.) using Pandas methods.

4. Create 2 new useful or interesting columns based on other existing columns in the dataset (e.g., a ratio, a category based on numerical values, etc.).

5. Make 3 interesting observations about the data based on your analysis, using Pandas queries and Matplotlib visualizations. Add storytelling in Markdown cells to explain your findings and why they are interesting/relevant.

6. Using Pandas again, export the modified dataset to a new CSV file.
